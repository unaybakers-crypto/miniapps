# FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the difference between a manifest and an embed?

**Quick Answer**: A **manifest** is your app's identity document (one per domain), while an **embed** is social sharing metadata (one per page you want shareable).

- **Manifest** = App registration at `/.well-known/farcaster.json` that identifies your entire Mini App
- **Embed** = Page-level `fc:miniapp` meta tags that make individual URLs shareable as rich cards

**For a complete explanation with examples and implementation guidance**, see our detailed [Manifest vs Embed Developer Guide](/docs/guides/manifest-vs-embed).

## Do I need both a manifest and embeds?

**For most Mini Apps: Yes.**

Without a manifest, your app can't be added to users' app lists, send notifications, or appear in app discovery. Without embeds, your pages won't be shareable as rich cards in social feeds.

## Are Frames v2 and Mini Apps the same thing?

Yes! Frames v2 and Mini Apps are the same technology. "Mini Apps" is the current name for what was previously called "Frames v2."

## Do I need paid APIs to build a Mini App?

Not necessarily. Many basic operations can be done with free tiers, but some advanced features may require paid services like Neynar for expanded functionality.

## Why isn't my app showing up in search?

Your app needs to meet several requirements:
- **Registered manifest** with complete required fields
- **Recent user activity** and engagement
- **Working images** with proper content-type headers
- **Production domain** (not development tunnels like ngrok)

See our [App Discovery & Search guide](/docs/guides/discovery) for complete requirements.

## Why do I see an infinite loading screen?

Make sure you're calling `sdk.actions.ready()` after your app is fully loaded:

```javascript
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'

// Wait for your app to be ready, then call
await sdk.actions.ready()
```

This is required to hide the splash screen and display your content.

## How do I test my Mini App locally?

Currently, you need to use tunneling tools like ngrok to expose your local server:

1. **Node.js version**: Use Node.js 22.11.0 or higher
2. **Tunneling**: Use ngrok or similar tools to create HTTPS URLs
3. **HTTPS required**: Farcaster requires HTTPS for Mini Apps
4. **Test your app**: Use the [Mini App Preview Tool](https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/preview) to test the app at your tunneled URL

## My manifest isn't validating. What's wrong?

Common validation issues:
- **Invalid JSON syntax** - Use a JSON validator to check
- **Missing required fields** - Ensure `name`, `iconUrl`, `homeUrl` are present
- **Invalid image URLs** - Images must return proper `image/*` content-type headers
- **Domain mismatch** - The manifest domain must match where it's hosted

## How does app discovery and ranking work?

Apps are ranked using multiple engagement signals:
- **Opens**: How frequently users access your app
- **Additions**: Number of users who add your app to their collection  
- **Transaction data**: EVM and SOL transactions within your app
- **Trending signals**: Recent growth and engagement momentum

Apps must meet minimum usage thresholds and maintain recent activity to appear in search results.

## Can I use my own authentication instead of Farcaster auth?

While you can implement custom auth, using Farcaster's built-in authentication provides better integration and user experience within the Farcaster ecosystem.

## How do I get notifications working?

You need:
1. A `webhookUrl` in your manifest
2. Proper webhook endpoint implementation
3. Users must add your app to enable notifications

See our [notifications guide](/docs/guides/notifications) for complete setup instructions.

## What happens if users don't have Farcaster accounts?

Mini Apps are designed to work within the Farcaster ecosystem. Users need Farcaster accounts to fully interact with Mini Apps and their social features.

## How do I handle breaking changes?

- Follow our [changelog](/docs/sdk/changelog) for updates
- Join the [Devs: Mini Apps](https://farcaster.xyz/~/group/X2P7HNc4PHTriCssYHNcmQ) group chat on Faracaster
- Use versioned dependencies to control update timing
