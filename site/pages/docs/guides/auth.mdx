# Authenticating users

An app can use the [signIn](/docs/sdk/actions/sign-in) to get a [Sign in with
Farcaster (SIWF)](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/siwf/) authentication credential for the user.

After requesting the credential, applications can verify it on their server
using
[verifySignInMessage](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/auth-kit/client/app/verify-sign-in-message).
Apps can then issue a session token like a JWT that can be used for the
remainder of the session. 

Session tokens should be kept in memory but not persisted in Local Storage or
Cookies. Since users are signing in through their Farcaster client their
expectation will be if they sign out of the their Farcaster client they'll be
signed out of any Mini Apps as well.

## User Experience

In cases where the Farcaster client (i.e. on mobile) has direct access to the
user's signing key (e.g. their custody account) this credential can be produced
silently without the user needing to take any action. Otherwise the user will be
prompted to sign in.

Farcaster clients are working to support silent sign-in across all platforms so
that users are never prompted to sign in on a different device.
