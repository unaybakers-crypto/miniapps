# Interacting with Solana wallets

Mini Apps can interact with a user's Solana wallet without needing to worry
about popping open "select your wallet" dialogs or flakey connections.

## Getting Started

The SDK enables Mini Apps to interact with a user's Solana wallet through [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-standard/).

We recommend using [Wallet Adapter](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/)'s React hooks to interface with Wallet Standard. You may also use [Wallet Standard directly](#using-wallet-standard-directly), or interface with our [low-level Solana provider](#low-level-solana-provider).

::::steps
### Setup Wallet Adapter

Use the [Quick Setup (using React) guide](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/blob/master/APP.md) to setup Wallet Adapter in your project.

### Install the Wallet Standard integration

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @farcaster/mini-app-solana
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @farcaster/mini-app-solana
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @farcaster/mini-app-solana
```

:::

### Render the Farcaster Solana provider

In place of `ConnectionProvider` and `WalletProvider` from the Wallet Adapter guide, you should render `FarcasterSolanaProvider` from `@farcaster/mini-app-solana`.

This does two things:
1. Importing from `@farcaster/mini-app-solana` has the side effect of triggering the Farcaster wallet to register via Wallet Standard.
2. Sets up Wallet Adapter to automatically select the Farcaster wallet.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { FarcasterSolanaProvider } from '@farcaster/mini-app-solana';
import { useWallet } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';

const solanaEndpoint = 'https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_API_KEY';

function App() {
  // FarcasterSolanaProvider internally renders ConnectionProvider
  // and WalletProvider from @solana/wallet-adapter-react
  return (
    <FarcasterSolanaProvider endpoint={solanaEndpoint}>
      <Content />
    </FarcasterSolanaProvider>
  )
}
```

### Use the Wallet Adapter hooks

You can now use Wallet Adapter React hooks directly within any component rendered downstream of `FarcasterSolanaProvider`.

```tsx
function Content() {
  const { publicKey } = useWallet();
  const solanaAddress = publicKey?.toBase58() ?? '';
  return <span>{solanaAddress}</span>;
}
```

::::

## Low-level Solana provider

The SDK also exposes a low-level Solana provider at `sdk.wallet.getSolanaProvider()`.
This provider is modeled after `window.phantom.solana` and its full API can be found [here](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/miniapps/blob/main/packages/miniapp-core/src/solana.ts).

## Using Wallet Standard directly

It's also possible to interface with the user's Solana wallet directly through Wallet Standard, or via Wallet Adapter's "core" (non-React) integrations.

In order to do so, it's important that you still import our package in your app entry:

```tsx
import '@farcaster/mini-app-solana';
```

This ensures that the user's Solana wallet registers with Wallet Standard.

Also note that if you're using Wallet Adapter without our `FarcasterSolanaProvider` React component, you'll need to select the user's Farcaster wallet before attempting any operations.

## Demo app

To see how a working Mini App uses a Solana wallet, check out our demo Mini App [here](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo/blob/main/src/components/Demo.tsx).

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Scanning

Modern crypto wallets scan transactions and preview them to users to help
protect users from scams. New contracts and applications can generate false
positives in these systems. If your transaction is being reported as
potentially malicious use this [Blockaid
Tool](https://report.blockaid.io/verifiedProject) to verify your app with
Blockaid.
