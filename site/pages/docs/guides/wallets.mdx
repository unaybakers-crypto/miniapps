# Interacting with Ethereum wallets

Mini Apps can interact with a user's EVM wallet without needing to worry
about popping open "select your wallet" dialogs or flakey connections.

## Getting Started

The Mini App SDK exposes an [EIP-1193 Ethereum Provider
API](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) at `sdk.wallet.getEthereumProvider()`.

We recommend using [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) to connect to and interact with
the user's wallet. This is not required but provides high-level hooks for
interacting with the wallet in a type-safe way.

::::steps
### Setup Wagmi

Use the [Getting Started
guide](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started#manual-installation) to setup
Wagmi in your project.

### Install the connector

Next we'll install a Wagmi connector that will be used to interact with the
user's wallet:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @farcaster/miniapp-wagmi-connector
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @farcaster/miniapp-wagmi-connector
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @farcaster/miniapp-wagmi-connector
```

:::

### Add to Wagmi configuration

Add the Mini App connector to your Wagmi config:

```ts
import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi'
import { base } from 'wagmi/chains'
import { farcasterMiniApp as miniAppConnector } from '@farcaster/miniapp-wagmi-connector'

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [base],
  transports: {
    [base.id]: http(),
  },
  connectors: [
    miniAppConnector()
  ]
})
```

### Connect to the wallet

If a user already has a connected wallet the connector will automatically
connect to it (e.g. `isConnected` will be true). 

It's possible a user doesn't have a connected wallet so you should always check
for a connection and prompt them to connect if they aren't already connected:

```tsx 
import { useAccount, useConnect } from 'wagmi'

function ConnectMenu() {
  const { isConnected, address } = useAccount()
  const { connect, connectors } = useConnect()

  if (isConnected) {
    return (
      <>
        <div>You're connected!</div>
        <div>Address: {address}</div>
      </>
    )
  }

  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => connect({ connector: connectors[0] })}
    >
      Connect
    </button>
  )
}
```

:::note
Your Mini App won't need to show a wallet selection dialog that is common in a
web based dapp, the Farcaster client hosting your app will take care of getting
the user connected to their preferred crypto wallet.
:::


### Send a transaction

You're now ready to prompt the user to transact. They will be shown a preview
of the transaction in their wallet and asked to confirm it:


Follow [this guide from
Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/send-transaction#_2-create-a-new-component)
on sending a transaction (note: skip step 1 since you're already connected to
the user's wallet).

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Scanning

Modern crypto wallets scan transactions and preview them to users to help
protect users from scams. New contracts and applications can generate false
positives in these systems. If your transaction is being reported as
potentially malicious use this [Blockaid
Tool](https://report.blockaid.io/verifiedProject) to verify your app with
Blockaid.
