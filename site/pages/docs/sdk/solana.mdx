# Solana wallet

The SDK enables Mini Apps to interact with a user's Solana wallet through [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-standard/).

Mini apps written in React can use [Wallet Adapter](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter/)'s React hooks, which are sort of like Solana's equivalent of Wagmi. Wallet Adapter also exposes a more low-level interface for non-React apps.
