# Client Events

When a user interacts with your app events will be sent from the Farcaster
client to your application client.


Farcaster clients emit events to directly to your app client while it is open that can 
be used to update your UI in response to user actions.

To listen to events, you have to use `sdk.on` to register callbacks ([see full
example](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo/blob/20d454f5f6b1e4f30a6a49295cbd29ca7f30d44a/src/components/Demo.tsx#L92-L124)).

Listeners can be cleaned up with `sdk.removeListener()` or sdk.removeAllListeners()`.
