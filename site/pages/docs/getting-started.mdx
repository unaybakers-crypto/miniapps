# Getting Started

import { Caption } from '../../components/Caption.tsx';

## Overview

Mini apps are web apps built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript that can be discovered
and used within Farcaster clients. You can use an SDK to access native
Farcaster features, like authentication, sending notifications, and interacting
with the user's wallet. 

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 22.11.0 or higher** (LTS version recommended)
  - Check your version: `node --version`
  - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- A package manager (npm, pnpm, or yarn)

:::warning
If you encounter installation errors, verify you're using Node.js 22.11.0 or higher. Earlier versions are not supported.
:::

## Enable Developer Mode

Developer mode gives you access to tools for Mini Apps, here's how to enable it:

1. Make sure you're logged in to Farcaster on either mobile or desktop
2. Click this link: [https://farcaster.xyz/~/settings/developer-tools](https://farcaster.xyz/~/settings/developer-tools) on either mobile or desktop.
3. Toggle on "Developer Mode"
4. Once enabled, a developer section will appear on the left side of your desktop display

:::tip
Developer mode unlocks tools for creating manifests, previewing your mini app, auditing your manifests and embeds, and viewing analytics. We recommend using it on desktop for the best development experience.
:::

## Quick Start

For new projects, you can set up an app using the
[@farcaster/create-mini-app](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/miniapps/tree/main/packages/create-mini-app)
CLI. This will prompt you to set up a project for your app.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm create @farcaster/mini-app
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create @farcaster/mini-app
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create @farcaster/mini-app
```
:::

Remember, you can use whatever your favorite web framework is to build Mini
Apps so if these options aren't appealing you can setup the SDK in your own
project by following the instructions below.


## Manual Setup

For existing projects, install the MiniApp SDK:


### Package Manager

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @farcaster/miniapp-sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @farcaster/miniapp-sdk
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @farcaster/miniapp-sdk
```

:::


### CDN

If you're not using a package manager, you can also use the MiniApp SDK via an
ESM-compatible CDN such as esm.sh. Simply add a `<script type="module">` tag to
the bottom of your HTML file with the following content.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { sdk } from 'https://esm.sh/@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'
</script>
```

## Making Your App Display

After your app loads, you must call `sdk.actions.ready()` to hide the splash screen and display your content:

```javascript
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'

// After your app is fully loaded and ready to display
await sdk.actions.ready()
```

:::warning
**Important**: If you don't call `ready()`, users will see an infinite loading screen. This is one of the most common issues when building Mini Apps.

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js Version Issues

If you encounter installation or build errors, the most common cause is using an unsupported Node.js version.

**Common error messages:**
- `npm ERR! engine Unsupported platform`
- `npm ERR! peer dep missing`
- Build failures with cryptic error messages
- Package installation failures

**Solution:**
1. Check your Node.js version:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

2. If you're using Node.js < 22.11.0, update to the latest LTS version:
   - Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) to download the latest LTS
   - Or use a version manager like `nvm`:
     ```bash
     nvm install --lts
     nvm use --lts
     ```

## Building with AI

These docs are LLM friendly so that you use the latest models to build your
applications.

1. Use the Ask in ChatGPT buttons available on each page to interact with the
documentation.

<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
  <source src="/ask_in_chatgpt.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

2. Use the <a class="vocs_Anchor vocs_Link vocs_Link_accent" href="/llms-full.txt">llms-full.txt</a> to keep your LLM up to date with these docs:

<picture>
  <img alt="setup mini app docs in cursor" src="/cursor-setup.png" width="auto" />
</picture>

### How does this work?

This entire site is converted into a single markdown doc that can fit inside
the context window of most LLMs. See [The /llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org/)
standards proposal for more information.

## Next Steps

You'll need to do a few more things before distributing your app to users:
1. publish the app by providing information about who created it and how it should displayed
2. make it sharable in feeds
