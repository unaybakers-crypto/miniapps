# Getting Started

import { Caption } from '../../components/Caption';

## Overview

Mini apps are web apps built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript that can be discovered
and used within Farcaster clients. You can use an SDK to access native
Farcaster features, like authentication, sending notifications, and interacting
with the user's wallet. 


## Quick Start

For new projects, you can set up an app using the
[@farcaster/create-mini-app](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames/tree/main/packages/create-mini-app)
CLI. This will prompt you to set up a project for your app.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm create @farcaster/mini-app
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @farcaster/mini-app
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @farcaster/mini-app
```
:::

Remember, you can use whatever your favorite web framework is to build Mini
Apps so if these options aren't appealing you can setup the SDK in your own
project by following the instructions below.


## Manual Setup

For existing projects, install the Frames SDK:


### Package Manager

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

:::


### CDN

If you're not using a package manager, you can also use the Frame SDK via an
ESM-compatible CDN such as esm.sh. Simply add a `<script type="module">` tag to
the bottom of your HTML file with the following content.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { sdk } from 'https://esm.sh/@farcaster/frame-sdk'
</script>
```


## Building with AI

These docs are LLM friendly so that you use the latest models to build your
applications.

1. Use the Ask in ChatGPT buttons available on each page to interact with the
documentation.

<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
  <source src="/ask_in_chatgpt.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

2. Use the <a class="vocs_Anchor vocs_Link vocs_Link_accent" href="/llms-full.txt">llms-full.txt</a> to keep your LLM up to date with these docs:

### How does this work?

This entire site is converted into a single markdown doc that can fit inside
the context window of most LLMs. See [The /llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org/)
standards proposal for more information.

## Next Steps

You'll need to do a few more things before distributing your app to users:
1. publish the app by providing information about who created it and how it should displayed
2. make it sharable in feeds
