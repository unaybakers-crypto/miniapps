# Why Mini Apps?

Mini Apps enable developers to distribute native-like apps to Farcaster users.
Mini Apps are the easiest way to deliver engaging, high-retention, and easy to
monetize applications:

- **Ship Fast** - Go from idea to users in hoursâ€”no app store reviews. Build
with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and use the Mini App SDK to deliver native-like
apps.
- **Get Discovered** - Social feed discovery puts users just 1-click away and
viral growth mechanics are built in. Users can find new applications through
Mini App stores.
- **Retain Users** - Mobile notifications re-engage users by bringing them back
when something new to do. Users can save their favorite Mini Apps so they are
always a click away. 
- **Transact Seamlessly** - An integrated Ethereum Wallet provides
permissionless financial rails. Users can send money, buy art, or donate in a
single click.
- **Build Social** - Users are signed into Mini Apps without forms or
passwords. Leverage Farcaster's rich social data to create engaging social
experiences.
